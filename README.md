# My own little corner of the internet
## The journey of making a personal website from scratch

Hi there! This repo describes a little passion project of mine: building my own personal website!  
The goal of this project was understanding webdevellopment at it's root, back to basics. This means that no fancy frameworks were used, no, everything is build from the ground up.  
I use a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, JS and SQL.
